# Liquidity Hook

This guide will walk you through the necessary steps to add your Liquidity Hook into INIT's frontend. Please follow these instructions carefully to ensure a smooth integration process.

## Prerequisites

Before you can submit your Liquidity Hook, please ensure you have completed the following steps:

1. **Liquidity Hook Contract Integration:** Your Liquidity Hook contract must be fully implemented and deployed on-chain. [Docs](https://dev.init.capital/)
2. **Verify Contract Code:** Ensure that the contract code is verified on the block explorer of the integrated chain. This can be done on platforms like [Mantle Explorer](https://explorer.mantle.xyz/) or [Blastscan](https://blastscan.io), depending on the chain you are using.
3. **Working Frontend:** You must have a working frontend application that is connected to your deployed hooks. This ensures that users can interact with your Liquidity Hook as intended.
